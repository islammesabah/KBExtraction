AI-Ethics & Data-Science Corpus (for KBDebugger MVP)

1) Human dignity and intrinsic worth

In many ethical frameworks, human dignity means intrinsic worth. Intrinsic worth should never be diminished by AI.
Equality is a human right and is a dimension of fairness, while equity is a subclass of fairness.
AI Fairness is an ethical imperative. Thus, it is a requirement.
AI fairness involves guidelines and practices that mitigate bias in decision-making models.

2) Data science workflow and preprocessing

A data science task often includes data collection and preprocessing.
Data collection implements data privacy.
Data preprocessing is a subclass of data science task.
Data cleaning is a subclass of data preprocessing.
Data augmentation is a subclass of data preprocessing.
Data integration is a subclass of data preprocessing.
Data visualization is a subclass of data science task.

3) Bias, risk, and fairness

Bias is a risk.
Bias is a threat_to fairness.
Algorithmic_bias is a subclass_of bias.
Bias is alignedwith harm.
Bias is associatedto application.

Data is a subclass_of informationentity.
Tabular_data is a subclass_of data.
Data gathered socially_constructed_biases can lead to algorithmic_bias.
Data gathered socially_errors can also distort a model.

Classification should_ensure fairness.
Demographic_parity contributes_to equality.
Equal_accuracy contributes_to equality.
Group_unaware contributes_to equality.

4) Explainability and robustness

Explainability is a requirement. It is  a dimension of transparency. It can sometimes affect accuracy. Explainability also helps contributes to robustness

5) People and attributes (bias-sensitive context)

Person is an entity and it is a subclass of thing.
First name attributes to person and it is attribute of person.
Gender is attribute of person and may be inferred from data.
