The IEEE 1232TM Artificial Intelligence Exchange and Service Tie to All Test Environments (AI-ESTATE) series of standards provide the foundation for precise and unambiguous testability and diagnosability metrics. It is the objective of this standard to provide notionally correct and inherently useful but mathematically precise definitions of testability measures that may be used to either measure the testability characteristics of a system or to predict the testability of a system. Notionally correct means that the measures are not in conflict with intuitive and historical representations. Notice to users Errata",

In defining the cost-related measures, this standard applies the categories of cost types as specified in AI-ESTATE, namely, time cost and non-time cost. The fundamental measures in 5.3.3–5.3.18 are based on the following proposition: — Cost is computed over a set of tests or repairs by using associated test action costs, repair action costs, and resource costs. — All cost calculations use the same units of measure and are based on resource cost. No unit conversion is included in the definition. Four versions of the measures (with the exception of probability_of_diagnosis and",
