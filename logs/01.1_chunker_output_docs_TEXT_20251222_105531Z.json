      "page_content": "Modern data-driven systems increasingly influence decisions that affect people’s lives, ranging from loan approvals to recruitment and healthcare. For this reason, fairness has become a core requirement in the design and deployment of machine learning models. A fair system should not systematically disadvantage individuals or groups based on personal characteristics such as gender, ethnicity, or socioeconomic background",

      "page_content": "Bias can arise at multiple stages of the data science workflow. During data collection, historical and social inequalities may be reflected in the data itself, leading to skewed representations of certain populations. In the preprocessing phase, seemingly neutral choices such as feature selection or normalization can unintentionally amplify existing disparities. Model selection techniques like train–test splitting or cross-validation may also introduce bias if the underlying data distribution is not carefully considered",

      "page_content": "Classification models in particular are often evaluated not only on accuracy but also on fairness-related criteria. Metrics such as demographic parity or equal accuracy are commonly used to assess whether predictive performance is distributed equitably across different groups. Achieving these objectives often requires trade-offs, as improving fairness may affect overall model accuracy",

      "page_content": "Explainability plays a crucial role in building trust in automated decision-making systems. Stakeholders must be able to understand why a model produces a particular outcome, especially in high-stakes contexts. Transparent explanations can help identify potential sources of bias and support accountability. Robust explanations are also important to ensure that small changes in the input data do not lead to inconsistent or misleading justifications",

Systems that fail to address these concerns risk undermining public trust and causing harm, even if they perform well according to traditional technical metrics",
