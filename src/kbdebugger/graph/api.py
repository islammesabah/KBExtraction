    """
    Retrieve a keyword-guided KG subgraph from Neo4j and return its relations.

    This function is a **public stage API**: it performs the retrieval and
    enforces a clear contract for downstream stages.

    Parameters
    ----------
    keyword:
        Keyword used to drive the subgraph retrieval patterns.

    limit_per_pattern:
        Maximum number of relations returned per retrieval pattern in the
        KnowledgeGraphRetriever.

    Returns
    -------
    List[GraphRelation]
        The retrieved relations (GraphRelation dicts), ready to be used as the
        reference set for vector similarity filtering.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If no relations were retrieved. This typically indicates that:
        - the keyword does not exist in the KG (or is too specific),
        - the KG is empty,
        - the retriever patterns are too restrictive,
        - or Neo4j connectivity/configuration is wrong.

) -> CytoscapeGraphPayload:
    """
    Retrieve a keyword-guided KG subgraph and return Cytoscape-ready elements.

    Why this exists
    ---------------
    - `retrieve_keyword_subgraph()` is a pipeline stage API and returns `List[GraphRelation]`
      for downstream algorithmic stages (similarity, novelty, etc.).
    - The UI needs Cytoscape.js elements: {"elements": {"nodes": [...], "edges": [...]}}

    This function is a pure adapter:
    - no new graph logic
    - no DB access beyond the underlying retrieval call
    - strictly typed UI contract

    Parameters
    ----------
    keyword:
        Keyword used to drive the subgraph retrieval patterns.

    limit_per_pattern:
        Maximum number of relations returned per retrieval pattern.

    Returns
    -------
    CytoscapeGraphPayload
        Cytoscape.js compatible graph payload.

) -> BatchUpsertSummary:
    """
    Convert triplet extraction outputs into graph relations, then upsert them.

    Why this exists
    ---------------
    The triplet extractor returns "ExtractionResult" objects:
        {
          "sentence": str,
          "triplets": [(subject, object, predicate), ...]
        }

    Neo4j upsert expects GraphRelation objects:

          "target": {"label": ...},
          "edge": {"label": ..., "properties": {...}}

    This function is the stage boundary that:
    - maps ExtractionResult -> list[GraphRelation]
    - batches all relations together
    - performs a single high-level upsert call

    Parameters
    ----------
    graph:
        Connected GraphStore instance.

    extractions:
        Sequence of ExtractionResult items. Each item corresponds to one input sentence,
        containing zero or more extracted triplets.

    source:
        Optional provenance string (e.g., PDF filename). If provided, it is stored on
        relationship properties under key "source".

    pretty_print:
        If True, print an upsert summary.

    Returns
    -------
    BatchUpsertSummary
        Summary across all relations produced by all extractions.
