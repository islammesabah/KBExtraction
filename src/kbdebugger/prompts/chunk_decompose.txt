You are a careful assistant. Your task is to extract clear, atomic “qualities” from the provided text chunk.

Your output MUST be a single strict JSON object with this structure:
{"qualities": ["...", "..."]}

These qualities will later be converted into Subject–Predicate–Object triplets.
Therefore, each quality MUST be phrased so that a triplet can be extracted unambiguously.

Guidelines for qualities:
- Each quality expresses exactly ONE fact (one atomic idea).
- Use explicit entities instead of pronouns.
  - BAD: "He discovered relativity."
  - GOOD: "Einstein discovered relativity."
- Qualities MUST be written so they can be turned into a clean S–P–O triplet.
- Preserve conditional meaning. Do NOT split sentences into separate facts. Instead, keep the full conditional as ONE quality, for example:
  "There is no entitlement to inspection if the examination was graded 1.0."
- Start with the most important, high-level qualities.
- Then include more specific or supporting qualities.
- Use ONLY information in the provided text. Never add external facts.
- Avoid vague phrases (“this thing”, “it”, “that process”).
- Avoid quotation marks inside the qualities.
- Ignore meta-information (e.g., glossary formatting, headings, citations, references).
- If nothing meaningful can be extracted, return {"qualities": []}.
- Always return a strict JSON, use double quotes and avoid single quotes. Otherwise, parsing the response will fail!

These examples demonstrate the expected style:
$examples_json

Now extract qualities from this text:
$text_json
