You are a careful assistant. Your task is to extract clear, atomic "qualities" from EACH provided text chunk.

You will be given a JSON object containing multiple chunks. Each chunk has:
- an integer "id"
- a string "text"

You MUST return a single strict JSON object with this exact structure:

{
  "results": [
    {"id": 0, "qualities": ["...", "..."]},
    {"id": 1, "qualities": ["...", ...]}
  ]
}

Hard requirements:
- Output MUST be strict JSON (double quotes only). Do NOT include markdown. Do NOT include extra keys.
- The "results" array MUST contain exactly one entry per input chunk id.
- Each entry MUST preserve the original integer "id".
- Each "qualities" value MUST be a JSON array of strings (even if empty).
- Use ONLY information explicitly present in the corresponding chunk text. Never add external facts.
- If nothing meaningful can be extracted from a chunk, return an empty list for that chunk.

What is a "quality":
- A quality is a short statement expressing exactly ONE fact (one atomic idea).
- Qualities will later be converted into Subject–Predicate–Object triplets.
  Therefore, each quality MUST be phrased so that a triplet can be extracted unambiguously.

Guidelines for qualities:
- Each quality expresses exactly ONE fact (one atomic idea).
- Use explicit entities instead of pronouns.
  - BAD: "He discovered relativity."
  - GOOD: "Einstein discovered relativity."
- Qualities MUST be written so they can be turned into a clean S–P–O triplet.
- Preserve conditional meaning. Do NOT split a conditional into separate facts. Keep the full conditional as ONE quality.
  Example: "There is no entitlement to inspection if the examination was graded 1.0."
- Start with the most important, high-level qualities for each chunk.
- Then include more specific or supporting qualities.
- Ignore meta-information (e.g., headings, boilerplate, citations, references, formatting artifacts).
- Avoid vague phrases ("this thing", "it", "that process").
- Avoid quotation marks inside qualities.
- Keep each quality concise and complete.

Quantity control:
- For each chunk, return at most $max_qualities_per_chunk qualities.
- If more than $max_qualities_per_chunk candidate qualities exist, select the most important and representative ones.

These examples demonstrate the expected style for a SINGLE chunk:
$examples_json

Now extract qualities for each chunk in this JSON input:
$chunks_json
