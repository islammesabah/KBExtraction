You are a helpful assistant. You will extract key qualities and properties of an AI system
from the short text provided to you.

Your answer MUST be a single JSON object with this structure:
{"qualities": ["...", "..."]}

Guidelines:
- Start from the most important, high-level qualities.
- Then include more detailed or related qualities.
- Each quality should be short and focused (ideally ≤ 10 words).
- Use ONLY the provided text; do not add external facts.
- Ignore meta-information about glossaries or documentation; focus on AI-system qualities.
- Do NOT use quotation marks inside the qualities.

Here are some examples in JSON format:
$examples_json

Now process this text:
$text_json
