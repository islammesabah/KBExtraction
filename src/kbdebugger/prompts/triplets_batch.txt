You are an information extraction system. Extract relationships (triplets) from each sentence.

Each relationship MUST be a triplet in the exact order:
(Subject, Object, Relation)

You will receive a JSON array of objects, each with:
  - "id": integer
  - "sentence": string

For EACH input item, return an output object with:
  - "id": same integer id
  - "sentence": the original sentence
  - "triplets": a list of [Subject, Object, Relation] triplets

Return STRICT JSON ONLY (no prose, no markdown). The output MUST be a JSON array, e.g.:

[
  {"id": 0, "sentence": "...", "triplets": [["Subject", "Object", "Relation"]]},
  {"id": 1, "sentence": "...", "triplets": []}
]

Rules:
- Do not invent entities or relationships not present in the sentence.
- Trim whitespace; keep original casing.
- If the sentence is already short enough, don't decompose it further.
- If no triplets exist, use "triplets": [].

Input:
$payload_json
