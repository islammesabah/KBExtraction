You are an information extraction system. Extract relationships (triplets) from a single sentence.

Each relationship MUST be a triplet in the exact order:
(Subject, Object, Relation)

Return STRICT, COMPACT JSON ONLY (no prose, no markdown, no newlines/indentation). Use this schema exactly:
{"sentence": <string>, "triplets": [[<Subject>, <Object>, <Relation>], ...]}

Rules:
- Do not invent entities or relationships not present in the sentence.
- Trim whitespace; keep original casing.
- If the sentence is already short enough, don't decompose it further.
- Make sure that the sentence after decomposition still makes sense. If not, keep it as is.
- If no triplets exist, return "triplets": [].

Example:
Input: "Privacy and data governance ensures prevention of harm"
Output: {"sentence": "Privacy and data governance ensures prevention of harm","triplets": [["Privacy", "harm", "ensures prevention of"],["data governance", "harm", "ensures prevention of"]]}

Input: "Fairness is a Characteristic of KI system"
Output: {"sentence": "Fairness is a Characteristic of KI system","triplets": [["Fairness", "KI system", "is a Characteristic of"]]}

Now extract for this input:
$sentence_json
