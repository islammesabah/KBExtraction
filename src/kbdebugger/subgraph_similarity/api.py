    Public API: run the full vector similarity filter stage.

    Hides:
    - encoder initialization
    - filter initialization
    - index building

    Parameters:
        kg_relations:
            The retrieved subgraph relations for a given keyword.
            This subgraph is used to build the vector index.
            i.e. it is our search space here.

        qualities:
            The candidate qualities extracted from a corpus (e.g. decomposer output).
            Each quality will be treated as a query vector and its cosine similarity
            to the subgraph relation vectors will be computed.

        cfg:
            Configuration for the vector similarity filter stage.

        pretty_print:
            Whether to pretty-print the filtering results to console.
