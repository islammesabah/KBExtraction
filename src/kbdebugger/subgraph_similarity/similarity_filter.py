"""
Vector similarity filter for *candidate qualities* (atomic sentences).

What changed (important)
-----------------------
Vector similarity does not actually require structured triplets — it requires semantic meaning.
That meaning is best represented by the *quality sentence* produced by the
Decomposer module.

So in this pipeline, we do:

    1) Decomposer LLM -> Qualities (atomic sentences)
    2) Graph Retriever -> KG subgraph relations (each has r.sentence)
    3) SubgraphSimilarityFilter -> compare qualities vs KG sentences
    4) Triplet extractor LLM -> run ONLY on the kept qualities

This change reduces LLM load and improves semantic matching quality.

Core idea
---------
- Build an in-memory *vector index* over KG subgraph sentences (r.sentence).
- Embed each *quality sentence* as a query vector and run cosine similarity search over the index.
- Drop quality if max similarity < threshold. e.g., 0.7
- Keep quality and store its top-k nearest KG relations as "context".

This module is intentionally:
- pure (no I/O, no DB writes)
- deterministic (given encoder + inputs)
- easy to test

Dependencies
------------
This module depends on:
- kbdebugger.subgraph_similarity.encoder.TextEncoder (pluggable embedding model)
- kbdebugger.subgraph_similarity.index.VectorIndex (pluggable vector index backend; HNSW in MVP)

    Design goals
    ------------
    - Produce text that is stylistically similar to decomposer "qualities"
      (plain English sentences).
    - Avoid structured metadata prefixes like "Source:", "Predicate:", etc.,
      because qualities are embedded as raw sentences.
    - Be robust to missing properties.

    Strategy
    --------
    1) Prefer an existing provenance sentence (r.edge.properties["sentence"]).
       This is assumed to be the strongest semantic signal.
    2) Normalize snake_case tokens into natural language.
    3) If no sentence is available, synthesize a simple natural sentence:
           "<source> <predicate phrase> <target>"

    Examples
    --------
    Input relation:
        bias --is_threat_to--> fairness

    """
    Filter Decomposer-produced qualities using similarity to a KG subgraph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    encoder:
        A TextEncoder (embedding model wrapper). Must be used consistently for:
            - KG relation sentences
            - candidate qualities

        If different encoders are used, vector similarity becomes meaningless.

    top_k:
        How many nearest KG relations to retrieve per quality (i.e., query vector).
        These are preserved as context for later semantic verification.

        Typical values:
            3-10

    threshold:
        Minimum cosine similarity required for a quality to be kept.

        Decision rule:
            - Compute k nearest neighbor similarity scores for each quality (i.e., query vector).
            - max_score = max(scores)
            - if max_score < threshold -> DROP quality
            - else -> KEEP quality, and store neighbors as context

        Tuning:
            Start around 0.50-0.65 depending on our embedding model and corpus.
            Lower thresholds keep more candidates; higher thresholds reduce LLM load.
