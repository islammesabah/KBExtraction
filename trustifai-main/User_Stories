To-Be Done:
* Unify dataframe for all logs
* Record user name for save it in logs
* User could update all system decisions like (sentence decomposition, edge creation, add more edges if there is more than one, ..etc )
* User not need to write lots of inputs just enter or escape could be ok , minimal inputs by user.
* Add configuration to either expand Knowledge based on specific subgraph or to upload all information in the given data source [PDF].
* Add a session vector database to check if a sentence/chunk information is already uploaded in the current runnable session if uploaded then skip it.
* 

Done:
+ As a user, I can choose to chunk the inserted PDF into longer chunks instead of sentences so that more information is available for retrieval in the graph.
+ As a user, I can update the system output to correct any errors made by the system.
+ As a system, I can log all user decisions to improve decision-making and determine when to request human feedback.
+ As a system, I can log users updates to improve decision-making and determine when to request human feedback.
